Student Transcript, Advanced Object-Oriented Programming
A java program based on object-oriented principles that generates a student transcript and calculates their GPA.
The program uses a scanner class to read a .txt file containing a sequence of information about the students, the courses they have taken and their scores in each course.
To start with the program, the first step was to read, study and understand a given .txt file and a UML, then implement the code accordingly by making use of object-oriented programming features such as encapsulation, static factory method, overridden methods, static and non-static components of an object and exception handling
Also, another important aspect of the project is the documentation of the code
