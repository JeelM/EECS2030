# EECS2030 Project Advanced OOP JAVA
**Student Transcript, Advanced Object-Oriented Programming.**\
A java program based on object-oriented principles that generates a student transcript and calculates their GPA.
The program uses a scanner class to read a .txt file containing a sequence of information about the students, the courses they have taken and their scores in each course.\
To start with the program, the first step was to read, study and understand a given *.txt file* and a *UML*, then implement the code accordingly by making use of object-oriented programming features such as encapsulation, static factory method, overridden methods, static and non-static components of an object and exception handling.\
Also, another important aspect of the project is the documentation of the code.\
The input.txt file that has to be read follows the given format:\
***EECS2030,3,1000,P10(90),P10(80),P30(60),E15(60),E15(44),E20(80),John***\
This explains that John, whose student number is 1000 has taken EECS2030, which is a three credits course. This
course has three practical activities, which worth 10, 10 and 30 percent of the total mark, respectively. Also,
this course has three exams, which worth 15, 15 and 20 percent of the final mark, respectively. Please note that
the total of the weights must always be 100. The numbers that are in parenthesis shows the grade that John
has received out of 100 for each assessment.
